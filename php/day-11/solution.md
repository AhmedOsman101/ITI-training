# Data Manipulating Language

## 1. Insert your personal data to the employee table as a new employee in department number 30, SSN = 102672, Superssn = 112233.

```sql
INSERT INTO
  employee ( fname, lname, ssn, bdate, address, gender, salary, superssn, dno )
VALUES
  ( 'Ahmad', 'Othman', 102672, '2005-12-15', 'Nasr City, Cairo', 'm', '9999.00', 112233, 30 );
```

## 2. Insert another employee with personal data your friend as new employee in department number 30, SSN = 102660 but donâ€™t enter any value for salary or super number to him.

```sql
INSERT INTO
  employee (fname, lname, ssn, bdate, address, gender, dno)
VALUES
  ('besto', 'friendo', 102660, '2005-12-15', 'Nasr City, Cairo', 'm', 30);
```

## 3. In the department table insert new department called "DEPT IT" , with id 100, employee with SSN = 112233 as a manager for this department.

The start date for this manager is '2006-11-01'

```sql
INSERT INTO
  department (dname, dnum, mgrssn, mgrstartdate)
VALUES
  ('DEPT IT', 100, 112233, '2006-11-01');
```

## 4. Do what is required if you know that : Mrs.Noha Mohamed moved to be the manager of the new department (id = 100), and they give your friend her position

a. First try to update her record in your database.

```sql
-- Set department number for Noha
UPDATE employee
SET dno = 100
WHERE ssn = (SELECT ssn FROM employee WHERE fname = 'noha' AND lname = 'mohamed');

-- Set department number for my friend
UPDATE employee
SET dno = 20
WHERE ssn = (SELECT ssn FROM employee WHERE fname = 'besto' AND lname = 'friendo');
```

b. Update your friend record to be department 20 manager.

```sql
-- First make my friend the manager for department 20
UPDATE department
SET mgrssn = (SELECT ssn FROM employee WHERE fname = 'besto' AND lname = 'friendo')
WHERE dnum = 20;

-- Then make Noha the manager for department 100
UPDATE department
SET mgrssn = (SELECT ssn FROM employee WHERE fname = 'noha' AND lname = 'mohamed')
WHERE dnum = 100;
```

## 5. Unfortunately the company ended the contract with Mr.Kamel Mohamed so try to delete his data from your database in case you know that you will be temporary in his position.

```sql
-- First take Kamel's place
-- In department table
UPDATE department
SET mgrssn = (SELECT ssn FROM employee WHERE fname = 'Ahmad' AND lname = 'Othman')
WHERE mgrssn = (SELECT ssn FROM employee WHERE fname = 'kamel' AND lname = 'mohamed');

-- In employee table
UPDATE employee
SET superssn = (SELECT ssn FROM employee WHERE fname = 'Ahmad' AND lname = 'Othman')
WHERE superssn = (SELECT ssn FROM employee WHERE fname = 'kamel' AND lname = 'mohamed');

-- Then delete him
-- This will also delete his dependants (CASCADE ON DELETE)
DELETE FROM employee
WHERE
  fname = 'kamel'
  AND lname = 'mohamed';
```

## 6. And your salary has been upgraded by 20 precent of its last

```sql
UPDATE employee
SET dno = 10, salary = salary * 1.20
WHERE fname = 'Ahmad' AND lname = 'Othman';
```
